# C language labs

The only lab work worthy of attention is the fourth. 

Describe a structure called dictionary that contains the following fields:
- word;
- translation;
- usage example in a sentence.


Write a program that does the following:
- enter data from the keyboard into an array consisting of a maximum of 5 elements of type dictionary,
and make it possible to interrupt the input so that you don't have to input all 5
elements; 
- after typing, sort the array elements alphabetically by
initial word;
- output to the console information about the translation of the word entered from the keyboard;
- if there is no such word, display an appropriate message;


Implement the second version of the program, using a doubly linked list instead of an array;
add the elements so that the list is alphabetically ordered
alphabetical ordering (insert a new item after the one that is smaller than the new one and before the
before a larger element).
